# CyberCommand

CyberCommand is a pack of useful commands in Python to the Splunk search language.

## Usage

There is a list of commands:
- base16 encode (ccb16enc) and decoder (ccb16dec)
- base32 encode (ccb32enc) and decoder (ccb32dec)
- base64 encode (ccb64enc) and decoder (ccb64dec)
- base85 encode (ccb85enc) and decoder (ccb85dec)
- HEX encode (cchexenc) and decoder (cchexdec)

Examples:

| makeresults 
| eval field_base16 = "CyberCommands" 
| ccb64enc field=field_base16 
| ccb64dec field=field_base16_enc 
| table field_base16 field_base16_enc field_base16_dec

The first step produces a field with string content "CyberCommands";
The second step using the command to encode ccb64enc specifying the field "field_base16";
The third step using the command to decode ccb64dec specifying the field "field_base16_enc" produced in the last command;
The last command shows 3 fields each one with the correct property
